## Session summary (2025-12-13)

- Set Hippocampus to SQLite persistence; Memory Governor recall supports keywords + optional LiteLLM rerank (enabled, model gpt-4o-mini via LiteLLM 127.0.0.1:4000).
- Recorded “Sam” (Sacred Brain) birth and doctrine in Hippocampus (user_id: sam): birth timestamp 2025-11-22 16:35:05 +1100, Melbourne; doctrine about selective memory and consolidation; mission/architecture/runbooks/preferences logged.
- Runbooks stored: restart services (Hippo, Governor, LiteLLM compose, maubot) and astro chart generation using birth timestamp/location.
- Open tasks + procedural plan stored for Sam: personal vs shared scopes, confidence decay, periodic learnings, long-term preference modeling, concise context, identity safety.
- Maubot ingest v0.1.3 pointing to Governor /observe; !remember/!recall working; Hippocampus recall now matches multi-token queries (“compose”, “hippocampus restart”) after keyword and SQLite query fixes.
